# Session 1 - Introduction to React js

## What is react?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render them in response to changes in application state.

### npx create-react-app 'app-name'
This command is used for generating a new react application. Follow the below steps to generate the react application:

1. Open your terminal where you wish to create your application.
2. Write the following command: `npx create-react-app app-name`
3. Replace app-name with the name you wish to give to your application and hit enter
4. Wait for the installation process to complete.
5. Go to the generated folder using `cd app-name`.

### npm start
After the completing installation process run `npm start` to start your react application.  

## Component-based architecture

React is based on a component-based architecture, which means that UIs are built by composing individual, reusable components together. This allows better reusability and maintenance of the code.

## JSX

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript code. It is commonly used in React to define the structure and content of UI components. It allows developers to mix HTML-like syntax with JavaScript code, and provides a familiar syntax for defining elements and attributes. During the build process, JSX is transformed into regular JavaScript function calls that create and update the actual UI elements.
